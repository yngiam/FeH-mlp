This folder contains input files used to reproduce the work of separation calculations presented in the paper.

### 1. Top-Level Folders

- `001_bulk/`  
- `sigma_3_GB/`  

These directories are named according to the type of atomic structure studied:
- `bulk` — bulk structures  
- `GB` — grain boundary structures

### 2. Second-Level Folders

Each subfolder represents a specific simulation case:
- `001_without_H/` — structure without hydrogen  
- `001_H_run_1/` — first run with hydrogen  
- `001_H_run_2/` — second run with hydrogen  

### 3. Third-Level Folders

These folders contain the initial configuration files and corresponding log files for each separation calculation:
- Folder names are numeric (e.g., `4/`, `5/`, etc.) and sorted in ascending order based on the separation distance  
- A higher number indicates a larger separation between atomic layers or boundaries
