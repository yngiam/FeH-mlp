This folder contains input files used to reproduce the work of separation calculations presented in the paper.

### 1. Top-Level Folders

- `001_bulk/` — bulk structures
- `sigma_3_GB/` — grain boundary structures

### 2. Second-Level Folders

- `001_without_H/` — structure without hydrogen  
- `001_H_run_1/` — first run with hydrogen  
- `001_H_run_2/` — second run with hydrogen (same concentration)

### 3. Third-Level Folders

These folders contain the initial configuration files and corresponding log files for each separation calculation:
- Folder names are sorted in ascending order of the separation. That is, a higher number indicates a larger separation.
